    <p>Danny Ocean has just been paroled from prison. He is a free man, but he is not a man free from his previous life. Danny, and 10 other likeminded criminals, pull one of the most elaborate heists in Las Vegas casino history. </p>
    <p> The reason why I like this film is because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It is fundamentally just a movie about a petty man who wants money and to mess with his ex-wife's current husband. I like how elaborately planned the entire heist is, and how we get a glimpse into the various skillsets the cast possesses, and how they contribute to the team. </p>
